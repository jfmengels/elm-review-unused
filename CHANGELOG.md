## Unreleased

This version merges the [`NoUnused.Modules`] into the [`NoUnused.Exports`] rule.

A common issue when running `elm-review --fix` (or `--fix-all`) was when you had the two rules enabled and encountered an unused module.

While in fix mode, `NoUnused.Exports` would remove every export one at a time, which would likely be followed by
[`NoUnused.Variables`] removing the previously exported element. This would go on until the module is as empty as it can
be. At this point, you would finally be able to see `NoUnused.Modules`'s error indicating that the module is unused.

Whether you want to remove the module or use it somewhere in response to this message, this is a lot of unnecessary work
for you and/or the tool, making `--fix-all` painfully long.

By having the `NoUnused.Exports` do the work of both rules, and not reporting any unused exports when the entire module
is unused, this situation should not happen anymore, or not as exacerbated.

[`NoUnused.Modules`] is therefore now deprecated and should not be used anymore. It is removed from the `example`
configuration.


## [1.1.22] - 2022-04-14

- Fixed an issue in [`NoUnused.Variables`] where removing a let declaration would not always remove its type annotation ([24237116ada98791d8ff79630ca5d4eb632ef6ea])
